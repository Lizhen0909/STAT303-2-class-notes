# Preface {.unnumbered}


This book serves as the course notes for **STAT 303 (Sec 20), Winter 2026** at Northwestern University. It is the second course in the Python sequence and introduces linear models and other essentials in predictive modeling. Key topics include linear regression, logistic regression, cross-validation, regularization, and feature selection. To get the most out of these notes, please read the accompanying [textbook](https://www.statlearning.com/) before each class.

This edition builds on foundational materials developed by **Professor Arvind Krishna**, whose work has provided a strong framework for this resource. We are grateful for his contributions, which continue to shape the book’s development.

Throughout the quarter, we will update and refine these notes to improve clarity, depth, and alignment with course objectives. Because this is a living document, feedback is always welcome. Contributions from students, instructors, and the broader academic community help make it stronger and more effective.

If you have suggestions, please share them using our dedicated [Textbook Improvement Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=YdN2fXeCCEekd2ToNmzRvFkUhM6kW_BCnBZ2OTet_zpUQkk3SVoxUUgxM1RZN0dSNkZUV1U3VDUxNC4u).

We hope these notes become a helpful companion as you build skills and confidence in data science with Python.
